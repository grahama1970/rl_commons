    "review_text": "The Margherita pizza was absolutely divine! The fresh basil leaves were aromatic and the mozzarella was perfectly melted. It reminded me of my trip to Naples last summer. The crust had that perfect char and chewiness that you can only get from a wood-fired oven. This is authentic Italian pizza at its finest.",

The pineapple was fresh, not canned, which made a huge difference. My only complaint is that I wish there was a bit more ham. Overall, great execution of a divisive pizza.",
