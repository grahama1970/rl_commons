# Graphiti Feature Integration Task ⏳ Not Started

**Objective**: Fully integrate Graphiti-inspired features from `example_graphiti_usage.py` into the ArangoDB codebase, ensuring proper temporal data modeling, contradiction handling, entity resolution, and community detection functionality.

**Requirements**:
1. Implement all Graphiti-inspired features outlined in `GRAPHITI_RECOMMENDATIONS.md`
2. Extend the existing `MemoryAgent` class to support all features
3. Update CLI commands to expose the new functionality
4. Create usage functions for verification with real data
5. Ensure proper relationship tracking with temporal metadata
6. Implement community detection functionality
7. Add cross-encoder reranking to improve search quality
8. Create validation functions that verify each feature with real data
9. Ensure ZERO usage of MagicMock for testing core functionality
10. Implement proper validation tracking and reporting of ALL failures

## Overview

The project currently has a solid ArangoDB integration with a `MemoryAgent` class that implements some Graphiti-inspired features. However, the implementation needs to be extended to fully support all the concepts outlined in the Graphiti recommendations. This task will enhance the knowledge graph capabilities of the project by implementing bi-temporal data modeling, contradiction detection and resolution, advanced entity resolution, semantic relationship extraction, and community detection.

These features are critical for building a robust knowledge graph system that can track when information was true (not just when it was recorded), handle conflicting information appropriately, identify similar entities, and organize information into logical communities.

## Critical Testing and Validation Requirements

This project has strict requirements for testing and validation that MUST be followed:

1. **NO MagicMock**: MagicMock is strictly forbidden for testing core functionality. Use real data and real database connections.
2. **Validation First**: Every feature must be verified to work correctly with real data before proceeding to the next task.
3. **Track ALL Failures**: All validation functions must track and report every failure, not just the first one encountered.
4. **No Unconditional Success Messages**: Never print "All Tests Passed" or similar unless ALL tests have actually passed.
5. **Exit Codes**: Validation functions must exit with code 1 if ANY tests fail and 0 ONLY if ALL tests pass.
6. **External Research After 2 Failures**: If a usage function fails validation 2 times with different approaches, use perplexity_ask tool to get help.
7. **Ask Human After 5 Failures**: If a usage function fails validation 5 times after external research, STOP and ask the human for help. DO NOT continue to the next task.
8. **Results Before Lint**: Functionality must work correctly before addressing any linting issues.
9. **Comprehensive Testing**: Test normal cases, edge cases, and error handling for each function.
10. **Explicit Verification**: Always verify actual results against expected results before reporting success.
11. **Count Reporting**: Include count of failed tests vs total tests in validation output.

## Validation Structure Template

All validation functions MUST follow this structure as per project guidelines:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    
    # List to track all validation failures
    all_validation_failures = []
    total_tests = 0
    
    # Test 1: Basic functionality
    total_tests += 1
    # Test specific functionality with real data
    result = function_to_test(real_data)
    expected = {"expected": "result"}
    if result != expected:
        all_validation_failures.append(f"Basic test: Expected {expected}, got {result}")
    
    # Test 2: Edge case handling
    total_tests += 1
    # Test edge case with real data
    edge_result = function_to_test(edge_case_data)
    edge_expected = {"expected": "edge result"}
    if edge_result != edge_expected:
        all_validation_failures.append(f"Edge case: Expected {edge_expected}, got {edge_result}")
    
    # Test 3: Error handling
    total_tests += 1
    try:
        error_result = function_to_test(invalid_data)
        all_validation_failures.append("Error handling: Expected exception for invalid input, but no exception was raised")
    except ExpectedException:
        # This is expected - test passes
        pass
    except Exception as e:
        all_validation_failures.append(f"Error handling: Expected ExpectedException for invalid input, but got {type(e).__name__}")
    
    # Final validation result
    if all_validation_failures:
        print(f"❌ VALIDATION FAILED - {len(all_validation_failures)} of {total_tests} tests failed:")
        for failure in all_validation_failures:
            print(f"  - {failure}")
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error code
    else:
        print(f"✅ VALIDATION PASSED - All {total_tests} tests produced expected results")
        print("Function is validated and formal tests can now be written")
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit with success code
```

## Critical Failure Escalation Protocol

For every task implementation:

1. If validation fails once, try a different approach focusing on fixing the specific failures
2. If validation fails a second time with a different approach, USE THE PERPLEXITY_ASK TOOL to get help
3. Document the advice from perplexity_ask and try again with the recommendations
4. If validation still fails for a total of 5 attempts, STOP COMPLETELY and ask the human for help
5. NEVER proceed to the next task without successful validation of the current task
6. BE VERY CLEAR about exactly what is failing when asking for help

This strict policy ensures that we don't waste time on approaches that won't work and get human expertise when needed.

## Version Control Plan

- **Initial Commit**: Before starting implementation, create a new branch from main
- **Function Commits**: Commit after implementing and verifying each major function
- **Task Commits**: Commit after completing each task (approximately 1-3 commits per task)
- **Phase Tags**: Create tags at major milestones: 
  - `graphiti-temporal-model` after Task 1
  - `graphiti-contradiction` after Task 2
  - `graphiti-entity-resolution` after Task 3
  - `graphiti-full-integration` after all tasks
- **Rollback Strategy**: If a task implementation fails validation, reset to the last successful task tag

## External Research Strategy

If a function fails validation 2+ times with different approaches:
1. Use `perplexity_ask` to get specific implementation advice
2. Use `perplexity_research` to research current best practices if more detail is needed
3. Document all research findings in code comments
4. Use `web_search` to find package documentation and examples if needed
5. Implement solution based on research findings
6. After 5 total attempts, stop and ask human for help
