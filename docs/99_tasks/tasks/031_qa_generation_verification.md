# Task 031: Q&A Generation Graph Integration

## Objective
Enhance the Q&A generation module to integrate with existing graph, memory, and search functionality, creating enriched relationship edges and improving GraphRAG capabilities.

## Status: IN PROGRESS üîß

## Background
- Q&A generation module (Task 030) is complete and functioning
- Need to integrate Q&A pairs as edges in the knowledge graph
- Must complement existing memory and graph functionality
- Should enhance search capabilities through Q&A relationships

## New Requirements (from conversation)
1. **Q&A Edge Integration**
   - Store Q&A pairs as edge documents in existing edge collections
   - Use `type: "QA_DERIVED"` field (not `edge_type`)
   - Include rationale and confidence scores (0-1 scale)
   - Add temporal metadata matching existing patterns

2. **Entity Extraction Enhancement**
   - Integrate SpaCy for NER alongside existing pattern matching
   - Use BM25 for keyword/entity extraction
   - Leverage existing entity resolution logic

3. **Context Grounding**
   - Each Q&A needs rationale/confidence for corpus relationship
   - Track hierarchical context (parent/child sections)
   - Prevent hallucination through answer validation

4. **Review Workflow**
   - CLI commands for reviewing low-confidence Q&A edges
   - AQL queries for finding problematic connections
   - Manual review status tracking

5. **Search Integration**
   - Add Q&A edges to existing MEMORY_VIEW_NAME
   - Enable hybrid search across Q&A content
   - Weight Q&A edges based on confidence

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Integration ‚è≥
- [ ] Extend Q&A generator to create edge documents
- [ ] Implement SpaCy entity extraction
- [ ] Add BM25 keyword extraction
- [ ] Use existing entity resolution logic

### Phase 2: Context & Validation üìã
- [ ] Add context rationale/confidence to Q&A structure
- [ ] Implement hierarchical context tracking
- [ ] Enhance answer grounding validation
- [ ] Create review CLI commands

### Phase 3: Enrichment & Search üîç
- [ ] Auto-enrichment after Q&A generation
- [ ] Integrate with contradiction detection
- [ ] Add to existing search views
- [ ] Implement confidence-based weighting

## Verified Architecture

### Edge Structure
```python
{
    "_from": "entities/...",
    "_to": "entities/...",
    "type": "QA_DERIVED",  # Use "type", not "edge_type"
    "question": "...",
    "answer": "...",
    "thinking": "...",
    "rationale": "Extracted from Q&A about...",  # Min 50 chars
    "confidence": 0.85,  # 0-1 scale
    "context_confidence": 0.92,
    "context_rationale": "Relates to parent section...",
    # Temporal fields
    "created_at": "timestamp",
    "valid_at": "source_doc.valid_at",
    "invalid_at": null,
    # Review metadata
    "review_status": "pending|approved|rejected",
    # Embeddings
    "embedding": [...],
    "question_embedding": [...]
}
```

### Integration Points
1. **Graph Module**: relationship_extraction.py patterns
2. **Memory Module**: temporal operations
3. **Search Module**: hybrid search with BM25 + semantic
4. **Constants**: Add RELATIONSHIP_TYPE_QA_DERIVED

## Task Report Requirements üìä

### Report Structure
Each completed phase must have a corresponding report section with:

1. **Actual Implementation Code**
   - Show real code snippets (not pseudocode)
   - Include actual file paths and line numbers

2. **Non-Hallucinated Outputs**
   - Real ArangoDB queries with actual execution results
   - Actual CLI command outputs
   - Real test data and results
   - Performance metrics from actual runs

3. **Verification Evidence**
   - Screenshots or logs proving functionality
   - Error messages and how they were resolved
   - Edge cases tested and results

4. **Summary Per Subtask**
   - What was implemented
   - What challenges were encountered
   - What actually works vs. what needs improvement

### Final Verification Process
After all phases complete, agent MUST:
1. Review each task output in the report
2. Verify 100% completion and sufficiency
3. Confirm no hallucinated outputs
4. Run actual tests to prove functionality
5. Document any gaps or incomplete items

### Report Template
```markdown
## Phase X: [Name] - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

### Implementation
- File: [actual_file_path]
- Lines: [actual_line_numbers]
- Code: [actual_code_snippet]

### Actual Outputs
```
$ python -m arangodb.cli qa integrate --document doc_123
Processing document doc_123...
Created 15 Q&A edges with average confidence 0.82
Low confidence edges: 3 (marked for review)
```

### Verification
- Test run on: [timestamp]
- Database state before: [screenshot/query]
- Database state after: [screenshot/query]
- Performance: [actual metrics]

### Issues & Resolutions
- Issue: [actual error message]
- Resolution: [what was actually done]
- Verification: [proof it works now]
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Q&A pairs create valid edge documents
- [ ] Entity extraction uses SpaCy + existing patterns
- [ ] Context rationale prevents hallucination
- [ ] Low-confidence edges flagged for review
- [ ] Search returns Q&A-enriched results
- [ ] Temporal conflicts properly handled
- [ ] CLI commands fully integrated
- [ ] **Complete task report with verified outputs**

## Benefits
1. **Enhanced Search**: Natural language to graph queries
2. **Knowledge Gaps**: Bridge unconnected documents
3. **Temporal Context**: Understand when facts were valid
4. **Multi-hop Reasoning**: Q&A chains for complex queries
5. **Contradiction Detection**: Identify conflicting information

## Final Deliverables
1. Working Q&A-to-edge integration code
2. CLI commands for Q&A enrichment and review
3. Enhanced search with Q&A edges
4. **Comprehensive task report with all verification evidence**
5. **Final review confirming 100% completion**
