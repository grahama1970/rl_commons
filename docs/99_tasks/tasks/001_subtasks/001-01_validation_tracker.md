# Task 001-01: Create validation_tracker.py âœ… Completed

**Objective**: Create a reusable validation framework for tracking test results.

**Requirements**:
1. ALWAYS read GLOBAL_CODING_STANDARDS.md BEFORE beginning this task
2. Follow ALL guidelines in GLOBAL_CODING_STANDARDS.md
3. Track ALL validation failures - do NOT stop at first failure
4. Include count of tests that passed/failed in output message
5. Implement proper exit code handling (1 for any failures, 0 for success)

## Implementation Steps

- [ ] Read GLOBAL_CODING_STANDARDS.md to ensure compliance with ALL standards
- [ ] Create a reusable validation framework for tracking test results
- [ ] Implement functions to add test results to a tracking list
- [ ] Create report generation function that counts passed/failed tests
- [ ] Add proper exit code handling (1 for any failures, 0 for success)
- [ ] Include visualization helpers (colored output, etc.)
- [ ] Add documentation for how to use the framework
- [ ] Create example usage in the main block
- [ ] Verify ALL points from Global Coding Standards compliance checklist
- [ ] Document validation results in the summary table

## Technical Specifications

- File: `/home/graham/workspace/experiments/gitget/src/gitget/utils/validation_tracker.py`
- Execute with: `uv run python -m gitget.utils.validation_tracker`
- Expected output: Example of tracking test results with proper reporting

## Verification Method

- Verify tracker correctly counts passed/failed tests
- Check formatting of success/failure messages
- Confirm proper exit code generation

## Acceptance Criteria

- File executes without errors when run directly
- The tracking functions properly record test results
- The report function correctly counts and reports failures
- Code follows all architecture principles in Global Coding Standards
- Type hints used properly for all function parameters and return values
- Errors and edge cases are handled gracefully
- Code is under the 500-line limit

**IMPORTANT REMINDER**: NEVER output "All Tests Passed" unless tests have ACTUALLY passed by comparing EXPECTED results to ACTUAL results. ALL validation failures must be tracked and reported at the end with counts and details.
