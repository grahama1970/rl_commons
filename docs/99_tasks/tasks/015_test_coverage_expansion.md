# Task 015: Test Coverage Expansion

**Created:** 2025-05-16  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Goal:** Expand test coverage with edge cases, integration tests, and performance benchmarks

## Task List

### 015-01: Edge Case Testing for CLI Commands
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Status:** ⏹️ Not Started

#### Scope
Add edge case tests for all CLI modules:
- Empty inputs
- Special characters
- Very large inputs
- Invalid parameters
- Malformed JSON
- Network timeouts

#### Test Areas
1. **CRUD Operations**:
   - Empty documents
   - Duplicate keys
   - Missing required fields
   - Oversized documents
   
2. **Search Operations**:
   - Empty queries
   - Special character queries
   - Very long queries
   - No results scenarios
   
3. **Graph Operations**:
   - Self-referential edges
   - Non-existent nodes
   - Circular relationships
   
4. **Memory Operations**:
   - Empty conversations
   - Time paradoxes (future dates)
   - Invalid temporal queries

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] Edge case tests for all 4 modules
- [ ] 90%+ code coverage
- [ ] Graceful error handling verified
- [ ] No crashes on edge cases

### 015-02: Integration Tests
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Status:** ⏹️ Not Started

#### Scope
Test interactions between modules:
- CRUD → Search flow
- Memory → Search integration  
- Graph → Search relationships
- Full workflow tests

#### Test Scenarios
1. Create document → Search for it → Update it → Search again
2. Store memory → Search memories → Create relationships
3. Build graph → Traverse → Search connected nodes
4. End-to-end user workflows

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] Integration test suite created
- [ ] Cross-module interactions tested
- [ ] Data consistency verified
- [ ] Transaction integrity maintained

### 015-03: Performance Benchmarks
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Status:** ⏹️ Not Started

#### Scope
Establish performance baselines:
- Search query response times
- Bulk insert performance
- Graph traversal speed
- Memory recall efficiency

#### Benchmark Tests
1. **Search Performance**:
   - 1K, 10K, 100K documents
   - Simple vs complex queries
   - Vector vs keyword search
   
2. **Write Performance**:
   - Single document inserts
   - Bulk operations
   - Concurrent writes
   
3. **Graph Performance**:
   - Traversal depth impact
   - Relationship density effects
   - Path finding efficiency

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] Benchmark suite implemented
- [ ] Performance baselines established
- [ ] Bottlenecks identified
- [ ] Optimization opportunities documented

### 015-04: Error Recovery Tests
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Status:** ⏹️ Not Started

#### Scope
Test system resilience:
- Database connection failures
- Partial transaction failures
- Embedding service outages
- Disk space issues

#### Test Scenarios
1. Lose DB connection mid-operation
2. Embedding service timeout
3. Partial write failures
4. Recovery after errors

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] Error scenarios simulated
- [ ] Recovery mechanisms tested
- [ ] Data integrity preserved
- [ ] User experience remains stable

### 015-05: Concurrent Operation Tests
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Status:** ⏹️ Not Started

#### Scope
Test system under concurrent load:
- Multiple users
- Simultaneous operations
- Race conditions
- Lock contentions

#### Test Scenarios
1. Concurrent searches
2. Simultaneous writes to same document
3. Parallel graph updates
4. Memory operations under load

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] Concurrency tests implemented
- [ ] Race conditions identified
- [ ] Locking mechanisms verified
- [ ] Performance under load measured

---

### 015-06: Test Documentation
**Priority:** LOW  
**Status:** ⏹️ Not Started

#### Scope
Document testing approach:
- Test strategy guide
- Coverage reports
- Performance baselines
- Known limitations

#### Documentation Items
1. Testing best practices
2. How to run test suites
3. Interpreting results
4. Adding new tests

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] Test documentation complete
- [ ] Coverage reports automated
- [ ] CI/CD integration guide
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
