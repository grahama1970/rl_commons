Look how fast that was. That's so nuts.

It keeps your session open. That's

killer. And it can even show you icons.

Look at that. I'm using my mouse right

now. Such a cool tool. This thing is

kind of magic. How amazing is that? It's

powerful. I mean, look at that. That's a

superpower. 37 Linux commands. You will

not believe the last few. Let's go.

NCDU. Find out what's taking up so much

space on your hard drive. It's like DF

and DU, but better because it's visual

and interactive. Woohoo. I can delete

stuff right here.

and even drill down into

folders. Duff, the prettier version of

DF. It shows you drive usage, but it

just looks nicer. RIP Grap GP, but with

coffee. Powered by Rust. It can do

things like quickly finding errors in

your logs. Look how fast that was. Find

all your Python functions. That's so

nuts. Or files that mention an API key.

Seriously, it just makes Gre cry. Now,

when you're traveling, you'll want to

use Mosh to connect to your remote

servers. Why? It's like SSH, but it

supports roaming. Lose your connection,

go from Wi-Fi to cellular. It keeps you

connected, keeps your session open.

That's killer. So, we'll jump into my

remote server at Hostinger, the sponsor

of this video. I forgot my password.

This is embarrassing. Thankfully, I can

log into my Hostinger panel and from the

management console, change my password.

Okay, let's see if that worked. And hold

up, it doesn't work cuz I'll need mosh

installed on both sides. That's how it

maintains that connection. Thankfully, I

can log into Hostinger in my browser

terminal. Get that installed and let's

try it again. Boom. So, as long as you

have Mosh installed on both sides,

connection maintained. Now, while we're

sitting here in my Hostinger VPS, let me

show you another command. This is lshw.

This will show me everything I need to

know about the hardware resources in my

system. I mean, it shows you everything.

But if you want to find out just about

the CPU, we can do this. LHW do a tick

C. Let's say CPU, just the CPU info. AMD

epic. We can do the same thing for

memory

network

discs. And by the way, you do get those

specs for $6.99 a month. It's a whole

home lab in the cloud. Host some

websites, run some Docker containers,

practice some Linux commands, and if you

use my code network chuck, the price

goes down, which is a fun feature.

Picture this. Ping and trace route have

a baby. That's MTR. And that was weird.

This tracks latency and packet loss hop

by hop live. It's amazing. FD. It's like

find, but it has less letters. Also,

it's better. Better default settings

like searching recursively, case

insensitive, ignores hidden files and

directories, and it has colorized output

by default, and it's often faster. FCF

or FuzzyFinder, interactive filtering of

any list or pipe. We can look through

our history, pipe it into FCF, and we

can search through it. It's really

powerful when you chain commands

together. Doing something crazy like

this, so I can easily kill a running

process.

Ranger is like a gooey file manager, but

it's in the terminal. It has some Vim

goodness, bulk renames, previews. That's

kind of awesome. I don't use CD anymore.

I use Z Oxide. It's like CD, but it's

more forgiving. It will look at frequent

and recently used directories and rank

them. Check this out. I'm in the root

right now. Normally, I'd have to type in

tilda for my home directory to get to

downloads. But no, Z has learned me. I

can simply type in downloads, and it

takes me right there. If I type in ZI

and hit enter, it'll actually use FCF to

give me a selection of my directories

interactive. I don't use ls anymore

either. I use Exa. It's got better color

coding, tree view built in, and it can

even show you

icons. Look at that. Glances is your

all-in-one stat dashboard. It shows you

pretty much everything from a glance.

And it has a ton of options. You can run

it as a web server, which I could not

get to work. It didn't show me anything.

But it does run an API, so you can

monitor your stuff remotely. IO top. See

what's stressing your discs out. It'll

show you a top style list of the

processes using the most dis IO. And

it's updating in real time. If you want

to know every single little detail about

a file, look no further than stat often

built into your operating system. We'll

type it in, look for a file, and it

tells you everything from the day it was

born. I know number. And if we do -f,

it'll show us file system specific

information like the ID. Definitely one

of the nerdier commands, but still

pretty cool. Dstack. It's a combined

timeline view of exactly what you want

to see. CPU, RAM, disk, network, memory.

Run it by itself or add some options

like top CPU. This combines aspects of

VM stat, IO stat, I have stat, and net

stat kind of all in one. I use the watch

command all the time. It reruns any

command every so many seconds you set.

So, I might say watch- every half a

second for the

Nvidia-smi command, and I can monitor my

GPU cuz it's executing that command

every half a second. Progress is a

powerful command. Watch this. Type it in

here. And right now it's showing me the

progress of a secure copy happening in

one of my T-Mug sessions. See, there it

is right here. And I can actually type

this in on the other side. Although it's

kind of weird on the metrics. It can

monitor the status on any one of these

commands. Progress can also monitor

multiple commands at once. Now, we used

to use dig for DNS lookups. That's kind

of messy. Dog is better. I mean, look at

that. It's got some nice colors. Can do

DNS over TLS. Although NASA wouldn't let

me. You can output it in JSON. It's

powerful. Now, you may have heard of TCP

dump or even T-shark, but you know

what's better? Term Shark. It's

essentially a terminal user interface

for T-shark. I mean, look how fun this

is. I'm using my mouse right now. That's

awesome. Let's filter by

DNS. Oh my gosh. Is hostinger using

Proxmox? Ah, this is fun to see. Let's

keep that pcap. We can actually load in

that pcap again. and examine

it. Such a cool tool. This one might

feel basic, but it's very fun.

LSOF dash I. And then let's specify a

port. Let's say port 22. This will show

us the process that owns that port or

the one that's using it. Let's check out

port 80. Docker is using that one.

There's something I've learned 40 times

and I still forget how to do it.

Subnetting. Thankfully, there's a

command line tool for that. It's called

IP calc. It's a quick subnet calculator

that'll spit out ranges, mask, wildcard

info just from using cider. Check this

out. Let's do IP calc for

10.7.8 94 slash. Let's do a weird one.

18. All the info right there. Wormhole

peer-to-peer end toend encrypted file

transfer. This thing is kind of magic.

With one command, I'll start to send my

file, put it through a wormhole. It

spits out this command. And over here in

my hosting or VPS, I input that command

in and start to receive. How amazing is

that? Oh, by the way, that can be

peer-to-peer or with a relay if you're

dealing with a firewall. Why is your

system starting up so slow? What's

causing it? Who do we blame? We can

figure it out right now. Sorry, that was

a lot of energy. With the

systemdanalyze command and then add

blame at the end, showing you which

services take the longest on the last

boot up. We can also do critical chain

highlighting the critical path of

dependencies helping us to understand

the bottlenecks caused by sequential

initialization. PS I'm not using ps

anymore. That was lame. I'm using proxs.

It's a prettier, more friendly version

of psux. I can sort by

CPU. View a

tree. Way better than ps. Lazy Docker is

a treasure. Check this out. One command.

We get an interactive terminal user

interface for Docker. and you can do

everything. It's probably my new

favorite tool. I love RS sync for file

transfers. It's smart, delta only, so it

only syncs the differences. It can

resume broken transfers and mirrors over

SSH. Definitely the best way to copy

directories or large files. Did you know

that RM doesn't actually remove a file?

It just unlinks it from the file system,

but it's still there until it gets

overwritten. If you really want it gone,

you'll want to use shred. Shred

overwrites a file multiple passes before

it deletes, thwarting data recovery.

More utils gives us more utils, like

this. Use the TS command to add

timestamps to anything you're doing. Use

error no to find out what error numbers

mean. Use if data to look at your

network interfaces more simply. You get

much cleaner output. Use vidir to edit

your directory names and your text

editor, which seems very dangerous. I'm

scared. VIP allows you to insert your

text editor in the middle of a Unix

command pipeline and edit the data that

is being piped between

programs. You're going to love this one.

UNP will unpack any archive. I wish I

would have found this one way earlier.

What it's doing under the hood is pretty

fun. It actually guesses based on the

archive type what the command should be.

JQ is the JSON lightsaber. It will query

and transform JSON output. I can do

amazing oneliners using jq to grab

exactly what I want to see. Getting

pretty crazy with my output. Task

Warrior is task management from the CLI.

You really never have to leave. Check

this out. We can add a task. List our

tasks. How cool is that? Mark task

done. It told me I have more urgent

tasks. I kind of love this. I actually

might start using this. Hands down the

most amazing command on this list. Ask

Cinema or Ask Cinema. You can record

your terminal sessions into small

textbased cast files. Watch this.

I'm

recording and I'll do some

stuff. Hit control D to finish. Save it

locally and we can play it back. Look at

that. That's awesome. It's like it's

actually in the terminal. You can pause

it with the spacebar. Go in here and

copy the text. Keep playing. I mean,

that's so fun. You can self-host a

server that you can upload these

recordings to. And here's another

command you can use with Aski Cinema.

Ask Cinema a another tool they make will

convert your command line video into a

GIF or a GIF. I'm not sure how to say it

anymore. That is amazing. I'm just

thinking like when I want to show

someone something very quick in the

command line, just make a quick GIF.

GIF, send it to them. Fabric. If you're

not using it, you're crazy. Use the CLI

to interact with AI. I've shown it

before, but check this out. Combine it

with the commands we already know. For

example, I might pipe in my history and

ask it to summarize my mostused

commands. Look at that. That's a

superpower. Look at your open ports, get

some recommendations, use it to analyze

your SIS

log. And this I'm still exploring, but

the possibilities are endless. Use AI or

things like Olama to help you craft

commands on the fly. I'm a big fan of

Olama because you can run it here

locally. Check this out. I'll create a

custom Olama agent. Its only job is to

help me create commands on the fly. And

then I simply run the model and say

things like create a command that will

find out what is taking up all of my

disc space. Look how fast that was. Or

tell it to build an inmount

command. It's amazing. Which command was
