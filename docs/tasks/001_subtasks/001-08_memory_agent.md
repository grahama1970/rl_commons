# Task 001-08: Debug and Test memory_agent.py ‚è≥ Not Started

**Objective**: Debug and thoroughly test the memory_agent.py file to ensure it works correctly and follows all coding standards.

**Requirements**:
1. ALWAYS read GLOBAL_CODING_STANDARDS.md BEFORE beginning this task
2. Follow ALL guidelines in GLOBAL_CODING_STANDARDS.md
3. All validation functions MUST check actual results against expected results
4. Track ALL validation failures and report them at the end - NEVER stop at first failure
5. Include count of tests that passed/failed in output message
6. Use proper exit codes (1 for failure, 0 for success)

## Implementation Steps

- [ ] Read GLOBAL_CODING_STANDARDS.md to ensure compliance with ALL standards
- [ ] Review file content and understand purpose
- [ ] Identify existing validation functions in main block
- [ ] Update with validation_tracker framework if appropriate
- [ ] Create LIST to track ALL validation failures - do NOT stop at first failure
- [ ] Implement proper validation that compares ACTUAL results against EXPECTED results
- [ ] NEVER include unconditional "All Tests Passed" messages
- [ ] Include count of tests that passed/failed in output message
- [ ] Exit with code 1 for ANY failures, code 0 ONLY if ALL tests pass
- [ ] Execute the file directly to verify outputs
- [ ] If failures occur, attempt fixes and retest
- [ ] If 3 failures occur with different approaches, use external research tools
- [ ] Document research findings in code comments
- [ ] Verify ALL points from Global Coding Standards compliance checklist
- [ ] Document validation results in the summary table

## Technical Specifications

- File: `/home/graham/workspace/experiments/gitget/src/gitget/memory_agent.py`
- Execute with: `uv run python -m gitget.memory_agent`
- Expected output: Memory agent operations demonstration

## Verification Method

- Verify memory storage and retrieval
- Check context management
- Confirm query capabilities

## Acceptance Criteria

- File executes without errors when run directly
- All validation tests track failures and only report success if explicitly verified
- Validation output includes count of failed tests out of total tests
- Code follows all architecture principles in Global Coding Standards
- Type hints used properly for all function parameters and return values
- All validation tests verify ACTUAL results match EXPECTED results
- Errors and edge cases are handled gracefully
- Code is under the 500-line limit

**IMPORTANT REMINDER**: NEVER output "All Tests Passed" unless tests have ACTUALLY passed by comparing EXPECTED results to ACTUAL results. ALL validation failures must be tracked and reported at the end with counts and details.
