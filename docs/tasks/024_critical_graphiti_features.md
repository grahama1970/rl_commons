# Task 024: Critical Graphiti Features Implementation

## Objective
Implement essential Graphiti-inspired features that add high value to our agent memory system without unnecessary complexity.

## Context
After analyzing both Graphiti and our existing ArangoDB implementation, we've identified that:
1. We already have robust search capabilities (BM25, semantic, hybrid, graph traversal)
2. We have basic temporal relationship tracking
3. We have community detection implemented
4. We need to focus on features that truly enhance agent memory recall

## Revised Feature List (Agent Memory Focus)

### 1. Episode Management for Conversation Context ✅ HIGH PRIORITY
**Why Essential for Agents**: 
- Groups related interactions into temporal contexts
- Enables "remember what we discussed about X last Tuesday"
- Provides conversation continuity across sessions
- Actually used by Graphiti for temporal grouping

**Implementation**:
- Create episode nodes for conversation sessions
- Link entities/relationships to episodes
- Add temporal window queries for context retrieval
- Simple episode-based search

### 2. Simplified Entity Deduplication ✅ HIGH PRIORITY  
**Why Essential for Agents**:
- Prevents duplicate entities (e.g., "Python" vs "python language")
- Maintains clean knowledge graph
- Reduces confusion in agent responses

**Implementation**:
- Basic fuzzy matching on entity names
- Embedding similarity for same-type entities
- Simple merge strategy keeping latest attributes
- Automatic during insertion

### 3. Basic Contradiction Detection ✅ MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Why Essential for Agents**:
- Prevents conflicting facts from degrading responses
- Maintains knowledge consistency
- Critical for trustworthy agent behavior

**Implementation**:
- Detect conflicting edges between same entities
- Simple resolution: prefer most recent or highest confidence
- Log contradictions for review
- No complex LLM-based resolution

### 4. Configurable Search Methods ⚠️ LOW PRIORITY (Partial)
**Why Essential for Agents**:
- Different queries benefit from different search types
- Improves response quality

**Implementation**:
- Simple config to prefer BM25 vs semantic per query type
- Basic reranking options (already have cross-encoder)
- No complex orchestration needed

## What We're NOT Implementing

1. **Complex Deduplication**: We don't need Graphiti's complex LLM-based deduplication
2. **Advanced Contradiction Resolution**: Simple rules suffice, no LLM resolution needed  
3. **Community Summarization**: We have community detection, summarization is overkill
4. **Complex Search Configuration**: Our hybrid search already covers most needs
5. **Advanced Temporal Reasoning**: Basic temporal queries are sufficient

### Phase 4: Search Configuration (Optional - 0.5 days)
**Core Tasks**:
- [ ] Add simple search config dataclass

**Files to Modify**:
- `/src/arangodb/core/search/hybrid_search.py`
- `/src/arangodb/core/search/search_config.py` (new)

**Report Evidence Needed**:
- Config usage example
- Search method comparison

## Success Criteria

1. **Episode Management**:
   - Conversations grouped into episodes
   - Can retrieve context by episode
   - Performance: <100ms per query

2. **Deduplication**:
   - <1% duplicate entities after processing
   - Clean entity merging
   - Performance: <50ms per check

3. **Contradiction Detection**:
   - Conflicting edges identified
   - Simple resolution applied
   - Audit trail maintained

4. **Search Config**:
   - Can prefer BM25 or semantic per query
   - Existing reranking utilized
