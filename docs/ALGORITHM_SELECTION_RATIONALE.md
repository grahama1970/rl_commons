# Algorithm Selection Rationale

This document explains why specific RL algorithms were chosen for each project based on their unique characteristics and requirements.

## üéØ Marker - Why DQN?

### Use Case: Document Processing Strategy Selection
Marker needs to select the optimal processing strategy for each document from 4 discrete options:
- FAST_PARSE (PyPDF basic extraction)
- STANDARD_OCR (Tesseract standard)
- ADVANCED_OCR (Tesseract with preprocessing)
- HYBRID_SMART (Marker ML-enhanced)

### Why DQN is Perfect for Marker:

1. **Discrete Action Space** ‚úì
   - DQN excels with discrete actions (selecting 1 of 4 strategies)
   - PPO/A3C are overkill for such a small action space
   - No need for continuous control

2. **Experience Replay Benefits** ‚úì
   - Documents can be processed offline and learned from later
   - Past experiences remain valuable (similar documents appear over time)
   - Sample efficiency is crucial when processing is expensive

3. **Stable, Deterministic Environment** ‚úì
   - Document features don't change during processing
   - No adversarial or multi-agent dynamics
   - Results are reproducible for the same document

4. **Single-Agent, Sequential Decision** ‚úì
   - One strategy per document
   - No need for parallel/distributed processing during inference
   - Simple deployment model

5. **Value-Based Learning Fits Well** ‚úì
   - Can directly estimate the value of each strategy
   - Easy to interpret: "Strategy X has value Y for this document type"
   - Natural for A/B testing and gradual rollout

### Why NOT PPO or A3C for Marker:

- **PPO**: Designed for continuous control and policy optimization. Marker doesn't need to output continuous parameters or maintain a stochastic policy.
- **A3C**: Built for parallel, asynchronous training. Marker's strategy selection is inherently sequential and doesn't benefit from multiple parallel actors.

## üóÑÔ∏è ArangoDB - Why PPO?

### Use Case: Query Optimization
ArangoDB needs to optimize query execution plans by adjusting multiple continuous parameters:
- Memory allocation per operation
- Parallelism degree
- Join algorithms and ordering
- Index selection thresholds
- Cache sizes

### Why PPO is Ideal for ArangoDB:

1. **Continuous Action Space** ‚úì
   - Query optimization involves tuning real-valued parameters
   - Multiple knobs to adjust simultaneously
   - PPO handles continuous actions naturally

2. **Safety and Stability** ‚úì
   - PPO's clipped objective prevents catastrophic updates
   - Critical for database performance (can't afford wild swings)
   - Gradual policy improvements match production requirements

3. **On-Policy Learning** ‚úì
   - Query patterns change over time
   - Need to adapt to current workload
   - Fresh data is more valuable than old experiences

4. **Trust Region Optimization** ‚úì
   - PPO ensures small policy updates
   - Perfect for production databases where stability matters
   - Prevents performance regressions

5. **Multi-Objective Balancing** ‚úì
   - Balance latency, throughput, and resource usage
   - PPO handles complex reward functions well
   - Can incorporate constraints naturally

### Why NOT DQN or A3C for ArangoDB:

- **DQN**: Can't handle continuous actions without discretization, which would lose precision in parameter tuning.
- **A3C**: Less stable than PPO, and the asynchronous updates could cause inconsistent query performance.

## üîß Sparta - Why A3C?

### Use Case: Pipeline Optimization
Sparta manages distributed data processing pipelines with:
- Multiple parallel stages
- Dynamic resource allocation
- Real-time adaptation to workload

### Why A3C Fits Sparta:

1. **Distributed Nature** ‚úì
   - Pipelines are inherently parallel
   - Multiple workers can explore different configurations
   - Asynchronous updates match distributed architecture

2. **Exploration Benefits** ‚úì
   - Large configuration space needs extensive exploration
   - Multiple actors explore different regions simultaneously
   - Faster discovery of optimal configurations

3. **Real-Time Adaptation** ‚úì
   - Workloads change dynamically
   - Need quick adaptation without replay buffer staleness
   - On-policy learning stays current

4. **Scalability** ‚úì
   - Can scale actors with pipeline complexity
   - Natural fit for Sparta's distributed infrastructure
   - Leverages existing parallel compute resources

## üìä Summary Comparison

| Aspect | DQN (Marker) | PPO (ArangoDB) | A3C (Sparta) |
|--------|--------------|----------------|--------------|
| Action Space | Discrete (4 choices) | Continuous (parameters) | Mixed (discrete + continuous) |
| Environment | Static documents | Dynamic queries | Distributed pipelines |
| Update Style | Off-policy (replay) | On-policy (batched) | On-policy (async) |
| Stability Needs | Medium | Very High | Medium |
| Parallelism | Not needed | Moderate | Essential |
| Sample Efficiency | High priority | Medium priority | Low priority |
| Deployment | Simple | Careful rollout | Distributed |

## üéì Key Takeaway

**Algorithm selection should match the problem structure:**

- **DQN**: When you have discrete choices and want to learn from all experiences
- **PPO**: When you need continuous control with stability guarantees
- **A3C**: When you have distributed systems and need fast adaptation

Each algorithm was chosen to match the specific requirements and constraints of its target system, ensuring optimal performance and practical deployability.

## üîç Deep Dive: Technical Algorithm Differences

### DQN (Deep Q-Network) - Marker's Choice

**Core Mechanism:**


**Key Properties:**
- Stores experiences in replay buffer
- Learns from random minibatches of past experiences
- Uses target network for stability
- Epsilon-greedy exploration

**Perfect for Marker because:**
- Each document is independent (no temporal dependencies)
- Can learn from successes/failures on similar documents processed weeks ago
- Don't need a probability distribution over strategies

### PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) - ArangoDB's Choice

**Core Mechanism:**


**Key Properties:**
- Clips policy updates to prevent large changes
- Uses importance sampling for efficiency
- Maintains KL divergence constraints
- Actor-critic architecture

**Perfect for ArangoDB because:**
- Query optimization parameters are continuous (e.g., memory = 2.37GB)
- Need smooth, gradual improvements (can't suddenly use 10x memory)
- Must balance exploration with stability in production

### A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic) - Sparta's Choice

**Core Mechanism:**


**Key Properties:**
- Multiple actors explore simultaneously
- Asynchronous gradient updates
- No replay buffer (on-policy)
- Natural parallelization

**Perfect for Sparta because:**
- Pipeline stages can be tested in parallel
- Different configurations can be explored simultaneously
- Matches Sparta's distributed architecture
- Fast adaptation to changing workloads

## üöÄ Migration Path

If requirements change, here's how to migrate:

### Marker ‚Üí PPO (if continuous parameters needed):
- Add parameter tuning (e.g., OCR confidence thresholds)
- Change action space from discrete to continuous
- Replace Q-network with policy network

### ArangoDB ‚Üí DQN (if discretizing parameters):
- Define discrete parameter bins
- Implement replay buffer for experience reuse
- Useful if query patterns are very stable

### Sparta ‚Üí PPO (if stability becomes critical):
- Centralize training with synchronized updates
- Add trust region constraints
- Trade exploration speed for stability

The beauty of the RL Commons framework is that these migrations are straightforward - just swap the algorithm while keeping the same state/action/reward definitions!
